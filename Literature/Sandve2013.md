> - **Rule 5:** Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized
>   Formats
> - **Rule 6:** For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random
>   Seeds
> - **Rule 7:** Always Store Raw Data behind Plots
> - **Rule 8:** Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of
