# Hinsen, Which mistakes do we actually make in scientific code?, 2017

Experiment:

> Have two scientists, or two teams of scientists, write code for the same
> task, described in plain English as it would appear in a paper, and then
> compare the results produced by the two programs.

Differences:

1. "discrepancies between the informal description for human readers and the executable implementation"

2. "typos in numerical constants and in variable names"

3. "off-by-one-or-two errors in loops and in array indices"
