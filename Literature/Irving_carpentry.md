# Irving, Data Management in the Ocean, Weather, and Climate Sciences, Data Provenance

An example on how to (semi-)automate adding a full info on data provenance to a
netCDF file that is produced by a script.

Essentials:

- Include full call to the tool
- Include Git commit of the library

Main problem IMHO: This adds boilerplate to everything the user does and hence
will have a hard time sticking at least for scripts in actual analyses.  Good
thing for libraries, though.
