# Barnes, Publish your computer code: it is good enough, 2010

Central quote:

> That the code is a little raw is one of the main reasons scientists give for
> not sharing it with others. Yet, software in all trades is written to be good
> enough for the job intended. So if your code is good enough to do the job,
> then it is good enough to release â€” and releasing it will help your research
> and your field.

And:

> **It is not common practice.** As explained above, this must change in climate science and should do so across all fields. Some disciplines, such as bioinformatics, are already changing.

> **People will pick holes and demand support and bug fixes.** Publishing code may see you accused of sloppiness. Not publishing can draw allegations of fraud. Which is worse? Nobody is entitled to demand technical support for freely provided code: if the feedback is unhelpful, ignore it.

> **The code is valuable intellectual property that belongs to my institution.** Really, that little MATLAB routine to calculate a two-part fit is worth money? Frankly, I doubt it. Some code may have long-term commercial potential, but almost all the value lies in your expertise. My industry has a name for code not backed by skilled experts: abandonware. Institutions should support publishing; those who refuse are blocking progress.

> **It is too much work to polish the code.** For scientists, the word publication is totemic, and signifies perfectionism. But your papers need not include meticulous pages of Fortran; the original code can be published as supplementary information, available from an institutional or journal website.
