# Irving, A Minimum Standard for Publishing Computational Results in the
# Weather and Climate Sciences, 2015

Central point is addding the following to the author guidelines of any
publication in the field:

> If computer code is central to any of the paperâ€™s major conclusions, then the
> following is required as a minimum standard:
>
> 1. A statement describing whether (and where) that code is available and
> setting out any restrictions on accessibility.
>
> 2. A high-level description of the software used to execute that code
> (including citations for any academic papers written to describe that
> software).
>
> 3. A supplementary file outlining the precise version of the software
> packages and operating system used. This information should be presented in
> the following format: name, version number, release date, institution, and
> DOI or URL.
>
> 4. A supplementary log file for each major result (including key figures)
> listing all computational steps taken from the initial download/attainment of
> the data to the final result (i.e., the log files describe how the code and
> software were used to produce the major results).

- Provides good and comprehensive overview of the meaning of reproducibility in
the field.

- Stresses that this is only a starting point and a basic requirements (which
  would be "a big improvement of the current state of affairs").
