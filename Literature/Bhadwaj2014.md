# Bhardwaj, DataHub: Collaborative Data Science & Dataset Version Management at Scale, 2014

> Inspired by software version control systems like git, we propose (a) a
> dataset version control system, giving users the ability to create, branch,
> merge, difference and search large, divergent collections of datasets, and
> (b) a platform, D ATA H UB , that gives users the ability to perform
> collaborative data analysis building on this version control system.
