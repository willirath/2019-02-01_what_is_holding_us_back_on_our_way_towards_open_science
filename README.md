> ## Abstract
>
> There is a growing public debate around a “reproducibilty crisis”, journals
> expect the publication of data associated with a paper, and funding
> agencies enforce open-data policies more and more vigorously.  It is,
> however, often overlooked that the main benefits of reproducible scientific
> work are not in fulfilling these rather abstract requirements but in making
> ones own everyday work easier.  This talk will work out the specifics of how
> to ensure (or prevent) reproducibility, and hint at possible solutions, both,
> in the methodological and in the technical domain.  While it is not free of
> technical details, this talk aims at providing a foundation for a general
> assessment and discussion of the reproducibility of scientific everyday work.
